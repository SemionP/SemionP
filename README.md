I'm a Marine GeoInformation researcher at the Coastal and Marine Engineering Research Insitute (CAMERI) from the Technion, Israel. My interest is in satellite remote sensing, machine learning, and marine environment science. I mainly used big data cloud computing capabilities (like Google Earth Engine) to track marine environment and human activities on publicly available satellite imagery.

I mostly enjoy developing open-source remote sensing tools and creating web applications to visualize geospatial data. I also have experience as a data scientist solving regression/classification machine learning problems and developing new geospatial tools using GeoServer, Satellite APIs, and Deep Learning
